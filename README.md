# Spell-Checker

This program uses a hashtable of linked lists to quickly search a dictionary and determine if the word is misspelled.

Run the program by using gcc speller.c dictionary.c. Then choose a file to spellcheck by doing ```./a.out texts/____.txt```.

The small dictionary is used by default - to use a different dictionary, i.e. dictionaries/large, do ```./a.out dictionaries/large texts/____.txt```.
